          The serval is a medium-sized wild cat native to Africa. It has long legs, a slender body, and large ears, which help it detect prey in tall grass. Servals are known for their incredible jumping ability, often leaping high into the air to catch birds. They primarily hunt small mammals, birds, and reptiles, using their keen sense of hearing to locate hidden prey.
