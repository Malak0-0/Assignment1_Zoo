            The white tiger is a rare color variant of the Bengal tiger, known for its striking white fur with black or dark brown stripes. This unique coloration is caused by a genetic mutation called leucism, which reduces pigmentation but does not make the tiger albino. White tigers have blue eyes, powerful bodies, and sharp hunting skills. They are not a separate species but are usually found in captivity, as they are extremely rare in the wild. Native to India and Bangladesh, they face threats like habitat loss and poaching, just like regular Bengal tigers.
