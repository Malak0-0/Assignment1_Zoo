            The grey crowned crane is a tall, elegant bird native to Africa, known for its striking golden-yellow crown of feathers. It has a gray body, long legs, a white face with red patches, and a black bill. These cranes are often seen in wetlands, grasslands, and savannas, where they feed on insects, small animals, and plants. Unlike many cranes, they can perch in trees due to their long hind toes. They are famous for their graceful courtship dances, involving bowing, jumping, and wing-flapping. The grey crowned crane is the national bird of Uganda and is classified as Endangered due to habitat loss.      </div>
